These are some mathematical objects I have designed and 3d-printed.

Steinmetz solid (2 cylinders)
This object is the intersection of two cylinders at right angles. Because of this, it can roll in two perpendicular directions.

Steinmetz solid(3 cylinders)
This object is the intersection of three cylinders at all right angles. Because of this, it has the appearance of a circular disk when observed from three different angles.
